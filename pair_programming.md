# Pair-Programming Guide

Check-In w Each Other - take 5 minutes to check-in with each other, ask how each other’s day/week has been going, how you’re feeling, any struggles your facing either personally or w the program, modules you’ve struggled with, ah-ha moments where you’ve figured it out

Assign Driver/Navigator Roles - decide who will Drive and who will Navigate FIRST for this peer-pairing session, and alternate each session. the Driver will have their Repl open and will be the only one physically writing out the code for the solution; they will share their screen so the Navigator can see their code in the Repl. the Navigator will have their Repl closed, and they will look up code patterns, search the Mozilla docs, Stack Overflow, w3 schools, etc and direct the Driver on how/what code to add to the Repl; the Driver can make suggestions on what to write as well, but it must first be communicated to the Navigator, and you must decide together if that’s what you’re going to try first. SWITCH ROLES half-way through the pairing session, and alternate who starts Driving/Navigating each pairing session.

Do The Thing! - this is where you do the thing and work through your 1 Module Lesson together! (3.8 or 4.2, etc.)

Retrospective w ASK Feedback - at the end of the pairing session you will have a Retrospective; this is essentially another check-in at the end of the session. this is where you can check-in with your partner to see how they’re feeling and answer the following questions in an Actionable, Specific and Kind way:

How are you feeling?
What do you think went well?
What do you think didn’t go well (if any)?
Where do you think things can improve?
Any suggestions to make our next pairing session even better?
Do you have any particular learning styles you prefer?
Do you have any ASK feedback for me?

I recommend sticking to the Driver-Navigator roles until you’ve pair-programmed enough with. each other and with others that you’re more comfortable exploring other formats.
